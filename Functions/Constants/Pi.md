**?  vs pi**
Most of the time, 
it is not worth making a large distinction between the real mathematical constant ?  and the 64 bit double precision number pi.
However, since functions like sine are ill-conditoned at multiples of
?, and high school teachers drill into us identities such as sin(?)=0.
a certain emotional concern shows up when we see sin(pi) being merely
small and not 0.  Sometimes this feels perhaps unnecessarily like a disconcerting experimental error.  See (### The sin page) for further discussion.

The sine function is ill-conditioned for very large arguments.
The condition number is <put in formula>

My favorite example of this is sin(2.0^64) as I have seen many
different answers even from the same technical computing software
on different platforms. 

(See the discussion on whether whether there even is one "right" answer
 in the context of floating point.)
